Week 3 - This week was spent setting up jsp pages and servlets to initialize this application.  The application will now launch to the index.jsp file.

Week 4 - This week I set up my database for LocalLinks and created the user table which will contain all users of the application.

Lastly,  I created a servlet that will take search criteria and search the user table in the database and display the results on the results.jsp
