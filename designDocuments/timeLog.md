# Time Log Entries

| Week | Time Spent (hours) | Comments |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Week 1 | 3.00 | I spent this week setting up my development enviornment for this class | 
| Week 2 | 3.50 | This week I spent time finishing up my enviornment setup, completed the class activities, spent time thinking about ideas for my project, and set up my project's repo |
| Week 3 | 2.00 | This week was spent setting up jsp pages and servlets to initialize this application.  The application will now launch to the index.jsp file. |
| Week 4 | 5.50 | This week I set up my database for LocalLinks and created the user table which will contain all users of the application.  I implemented a DAO that performs full CRUD on the User javabean using Hibernate.  I also set up the test directory and implemented unit testing on the DAO (UserDao.java).  Lastly,  I created a servlet that will take search criteria and search the user table in the database and display the results on the results.jsp |
| Week 5 | 3.50 | This week I SET UP and implemented the user favorites DATABASE TABLE called 'favorites' as well as the unit testing for favoriteDao.java |
| Week 6 | 3.00 | I started out this week by expanding unit testing for both User and Favorite DAOs, implemented .equals comparison between User and Favorite objects, added Favorite search funtionality to the searchUser.jsp and results.jsp which means I had to add that functionality to the UserSearch servlet |
| Week 7 | 1.75 | Checkpoint 2 is complete. Will start implementing user login during week 7.  Worked on the CSS of the jsp pages to better match the mockup in the design. |
| Week 8 | 4.50 | This week worked on AWS Cognito functionality by setting up a user pool and creating servlets to handle the account creation, login, and authorization. I will explore the idea of creating custom account creation and login UI to match the rest of this project|
